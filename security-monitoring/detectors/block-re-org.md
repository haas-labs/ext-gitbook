# Block Re-org

**Behavior**
Protocol Layer reorg is when blockchain found another blockchain tip candidate. Previous observed block will not be part of blockchain

**Use cases**  
* Exchange & Custodian Double-Spend Protection - Block reorgs can invalidate previously confirmed transactions, opening the risk of double-spend attacksagainst exchanges or custodians. The detector alerts whenever a reorg occurs, allowing exchanges to delay crediting deposits or increase confirmation requirements during periods of instability.

* DeFi Protocol Stability Monitoring - A DeFi protocol executes critical operations (liquidations, oracle updates, collateral withdrawals). A reorg can cause these actions to roll back and potentially create inconsistencies. The detector provides early warnings of reorgs, allowing protocols to pause sensitive operations or re-validate contract state

* Regulatory & Risk Oversight - Regulators or institutional investors require assurance that critical blockchain activity (e.g., settlement, stablecoin issuance) isnâ€™t occurring on unstable forks. The detector logs and reports reorg events, creating an auditable trail of chain instability.
