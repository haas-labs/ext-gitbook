# Intro

Enhance your address's security with our advanced Security Monitoring feature. It constantly monitors your blockchain and key security parameters to safeguard your smart contract from potential attacks, unauthorized ownership changes, contract upgrades, and suspicious interactions.

By leveraging our Security Monitoring, you gain the power to identify early signs of potential hacks, giving you the control to trigger protective measures as needed.

No additional configuration is required for this feature, as it seamlessly activates the moment you add your address.
