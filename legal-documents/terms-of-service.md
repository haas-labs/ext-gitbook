### The App

Hacken Extractor is an advanced on-chain smart contract security system that provides real-time monitoring of your smart contracts and alerts you of any suspicious activity to prevent potential hacks.

### Account



#### Account registration and use

To use all App’s features, you must complete authorization and create a personalized account (“Account”). Enter your email address and create a password in the special page of the App to do so. We will email you at the previously specified address to verify it.

In addition, you may use your Google account for authorization in the App.

For every following login into the App, use your email and a created password or Google account.&#x20;

#### Problems with the Account

You may not transfer or assign your Account to someone else.

Please, immediately [contact us](mailto:extractor@hacken.io) if:

* you know or have any reason to suspect that someone has gained access to your Account without your authorization;
* your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised.

#### Delete the Account

To delete the Account in the App, please, [contact us](mailto:extractor@hacken.io).

### The App’s features and functionality

Hacken Extractor continuously monitors your smart contracts and checks every transaction against the specific condition or set of conditions set by you (“Triggers”).

If these conditions are met, the monitoring system will alert you in real-time, providing complete monitoring of your smart contracts.&#x20;

Some of the Triggers are enabled for every smart contract by default, some of them you may set by your own parameters. You may find the description of all Triggers in the App.

The number of smart contracts you are eligible to add depends on the chosen subscription plan, if applicable. Choose the appropriate subscription plan, and get more payment details by [contacting us](mailto:extractor@hacken.io).

To put the smart contracts under the App’s monitoring, you shall:

* Select how you would proceed with a Trigger setup: automatically or manually. We recommend choosing automatically because you'll get personal monitoring recommendations based on your smart contract type. But you may customize them to meet your specific security needs, ensuring that the monitoring system only reacts to important events.
* Add a smart contract to your monitoring list. You must specify its address, type and ABI;
* Choose the way you will get the monitoring notifications.

In addition, you may personally name every smart contract.

Once setup is complete, smart contract monitoring is active, and you'll receive notifications if any of the Triggers are met.&#x20;

You may delete any smart contract from the monitoring list at any time.

#### Smart Contract Actions

You may perform the smart contract function if the Trigger notifies you about the threats to it (for instance, put the smart contract on hold). This functionality is paid.

To obtain such functionality, you shall:

* create your own contract action provider through the App and give Extractor the right to perform the actions with your smart contract;
* replenish the balance of the contract action provider. Extractor calculates the approximate fee for set transactions by you (“Action Fee”);
* set the parameters of actions that may be performed with the contract action provider (“Contract Action”) (you may set Contract Action for every Trigger).

If all the contract action parameters for the Trigger are set, and the necessary amount of Action Fee is on the contract action provider balance – when the Trigger activates, the chosen smart contract function will be performed. In addition, you may perform the smart contract function yourself.

The exact amount of the Action Fee will be deducted from your balance after performing the corresponding function in response to the Trigger.

The chosen smart contract function may be activated if the contract action provider balance is replenished on the amount not less than the Action Fee to perform it.

You may withdraw the unused sums you deposited on the contract action provider balance.

### Payment

The user is obliged to pay the full amount of the subscription plan within the term indicated on the invoice.

The appropriate subscription plan should be activated within 90 days from the date the invoice is paid. (**“Activation period”**)

If the subscription plan is not activated by the user within this Activation period, the Company will automatically activate it the next day after the activation period is over.
