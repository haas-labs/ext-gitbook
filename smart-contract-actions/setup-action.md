2. Open the Address page in Extractor and go to the Actions page. Click on the Create Action button near the desired provider
3. Select a previously created provider
4. Configure the Action by filling in all provided fields. Additionally, the trigger or detector which will run this action can be connected. If you have not created triggers yet, [create one](../advanced-monitoring/triggers.md).&#x20;
5. The estimated gas fee price will be automatically calculated or can be specified manually.
6. Select the Notification channel if there is a need to receive notifications about the execution of Actions
7. Click the Save Action button to deposit the required amount to cover gas fees.&#x20;

Contract Action will be called automatically in response to a trigger and in case you have enough funds on the Action Provider balance to cover the transaction gas fee.
