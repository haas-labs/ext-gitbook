# Action Providers

Action Provider is a connector between your Address and Extractor. It is used to run contract actions and cover transaction gas fees.

In order to make it workable two conditions should be met:

* You need to give access to the address of the Action Provider to execute a function on your Smart Contract.
* It should be funded to have enough gas to execute the transaction.
