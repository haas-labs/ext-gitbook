# Connect Action Provider

In order to activate the Action Provider you need to do the following steps:

1. Copy the Action Provider address.
2. Give it a role in the contract you want to connect. Do not give an Owner role, otherwise, youâ€™ll lose access to the contract. (ex. Pause, Change Owner, Transfer)
3. Now the action provider is connected to the contract. Deposit the required amount to cover gas fees (you can see this amount during the contract action setup).
