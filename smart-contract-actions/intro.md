# Intro

This feature allows to set up administrative smart contract actions, such as contract pausing or emergency withdrawals, which can be executed in response to monitoring events.

You can access a list of available contract functions and set up Contract Actions, which means specifying the function call with predefined parameters.

These Contract Actions can be executed manually or set to execute automatically in response to specific monitoring events detected by the Hacken Extractor.
