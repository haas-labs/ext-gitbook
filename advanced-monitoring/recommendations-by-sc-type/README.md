# Recommendations by SC type

This page aims to provide actionable recommendations on how to set up triggers for different types of smart contracts. By following these recommendations, you can effectively monitor your contracts and quickly respond to potential security threats.

Each type of contract has unique security needs, and our recommendations take that into consideration. Whether you're dealing with a staking contract, a yield farming contract, or any other type, these recommendations will help you optimize your trigger setup for the best possible protection.
