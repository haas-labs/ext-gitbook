description: General information about triggers and how the work

# Intro

A trigger is a pre-defined set of conditions the Hacken Extractor system monitors. If these conditions are met, you'll be notified.&#x20;

Personalize triggers to suit your security needs and configurable notifications for each of events.

All triggers have the following parameters:

* **Name:** a descriptive name for the trigger
* **Severity:** the level of importance assigned to the trigger, ranging from low to high
* **Method params:** the specific inputs that are passed to a function within the contract
* **Notifications channels:** a setting to enable or disable notifications for the trigger. If notifications are enabled, the user can specify the destinations for the alerts
